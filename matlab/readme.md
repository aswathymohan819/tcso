This is the Matlab version of the Try catch. Use the try catch block used atached.
 You can use it in your projects. Please don't forget to make  improvements and submit a new pull request.

## Description
try statements, catch statements end executes the statements in the try block and catches resulting errors in the catch block. This approach allows you to override the default error behavior for a set of program statements. If any statement in a try block generates an error, program control goes immediately to the catch block, which contains your error handling statements.
exception is an MException object that allows you to identify the error. The catch block assigns the current exception object to the variable in exception.
Both try and catch blocks can contain nested try/catch statements.
